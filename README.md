# React Isomorphic

[![Node.js CI](https://github.com/zhelvis/react-isomorphic/actions/workflows/nodejs.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/zhelvis/react-isomorphic/actions/workflows/nodejs.yml)

A multi-page web application built with [React](https://react.dev/), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

It can be rendered on both the server and client sides using a common source code. By taking advantage of both rendering approaches, this type of application can significantly improve performance and reduce content delivery time at low cost.

I use this project as a template for developing web applications with frequent updates.

The project provides the following features:

- 🏗️ Flexible build configuration for typescript powered by [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) and [swc](https://swc.rs)
- 🔬 Static code analysis powered by [ESLint](https://eslint.org)
- 💅 Code formatting powered by [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- ⚙️ Runtime rendering analysis powered by [why-did-you-render](https://github.com/welldone-software/why-did-you-render)
- 🪝 Pre-commit code checking powered by [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)
